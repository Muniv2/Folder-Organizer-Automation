# File Organizer Project

This project was something I honestly thought I wouldnâ€™t be able to complete at first. However, I decided to give it a shot, and through consistent effort, I managed to bring it together. I studied the **os** module in depth and also familiarized myself with some basic functions of the **shutil** and **time** modules, which were crucial for implementing the required functionality.

## How It Works

This **File Organizer** script automates the organization of files and folders in a source directory. It performs three main tasks:

1. **Move Old Files:** It moves files that are older than one year from the source directory to a backup folder. If a file with the same name already exists in the backup folder, it renames the file by appending a timestamp.

2. **Move Empty Folders:** It identifies and moves all empty folders from the source directory into a new folder called "empty folder."

3. **Organize Files by Extension:** It organizes all files in the source directory by their extensions, creating a subfolder for each extension. Files without an extension are moved into a folder named "no ext."

The program uses the **os** module for directory traversal, the **shutil** module to move files, and the **time** module to handle timestamps when renaming files.
